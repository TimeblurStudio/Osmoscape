If a country's withdrawals exceeds the available sources, then the country is under water-stress. The study shows a global link between freshwater access and a country's GDP. High income countries reflect between 98-99% of population with access to an improved source of water between 1990-2016 followed by upper middle income at 76-95% and middle income countries at 72-92%. Lower income countries as well as countries that are classified as poor, fragile, least developed and indebted are struggling to meet water demands with a population between 40-70% having access to an improved source of water.

Water is supplied to the basins in the form of precipitation (snow and rain) or the melting of glaciers. The demand for water is mainly divided into three sectors—the domestic, industrial, and agricultural sectors—with the latter usually having the highest baseline water stress.

These were carried towards the north east by the wind patterns and mixed with the rainwater, fog and snow there, lowering the pH of water, making it acidic. A long-term monitoring of atmospheric deposition revealed that it was acid rain that caused the decline of several trees, including 300-year-old red spruce trees, and lakes of the green mountain. Similar well documented occurrences of acid rain have happened in other parts of the world, such as Norway, Germany, China and India.

The study shows a falling cotton production in 2016-17 when La Nina weather conditions existed. La Nina is an irregularly recurring upwelling of unusually cold water to the ocean surface along the western coast of South America that often occurs and disrupts typical regional and global weather patterns. There are critical questions being raised in the face of the current global climate change and a lack of infrastructure for careful allocation of water.

Tests were performed on children in Guiyu where levels of transition metals in their bloodstream were measured. These tests were used to bring about a relation between lung function in school children and exposure to transition metals from e-waste recycling industries in Guiyu. Blood samples were taken from 71 children of various age groups in Guiyu and 73 children from Liangying, a neighbouring control area, where there were no e-waste recycling centres. The test results showed that the levels of transition metals in children from Guiyu were significantly higher than those from the control area.

It was conducted in a fertility clinic with 21 selected patients with cases of infertility, when other reasons were ruled out. Their semen was examined for the concentration of two xenoestrogens, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) and phthalate esters (PEs), both prevalent in our everyday life. The study found that high quantities of these in the semen samples corresponded to low fertility in the male patients. The study further divided the men into different demographic groups such as urban and rural, fish-eaters and vegetarians, and combinations thereof. It was concluded that urban fish eaters were the most severely affected, the cause deduced to be the heavily polluted and untreated water that the people living in cities consume. The sound is represented by samples of water and capacitors doubled by synthesized electronics create a sound based on the distribution of PCBs and the products that contain PCBs which are a leading cause of infertility.",

Hypoxia is a condition where the dissolved oxygen level in the water is less than 2 milligrams per litre of water (2mg/l).The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. The region undergoes a seasonal hypoxia due to various processes.  Using mulitple technologies such as satellite monitoring, modelling studies, sampling of water column, sediment record studies, the US based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration conducted an extensive study between 1985 and 2013 to understand the occurence of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Since the 1950s, the duration of and the area under hypoxia has increased. Every summer, the area under hypoxia covers an area of about 15,000 sq km. A study shows that excess nutrients from untreated sewage waste or from fertilizers are causing the hypoxia.

Hundreds of thousands of people had to be evacuated from their homes. Apart from major health risks, the Fukushima accident caused the contamination of large areas that were, and partly still are used for agricultural purposes. Tests were performed on vegetables and meat to find out the amount of radiocesium, a radioactive isotope of Caesium, and it was discovered that most meat and vegetables were contaminated with the isotopes due to bioaccumulation. Import restrictions were placed on Fukushima. The Pacific Blue Fin Tuna is a favourite amongst fish eaters in the USA. It is a predatory, migratory species of the tuna that travels from the Japanese to California waters. A study was conducted shortly after the disaster to detect the amount of radionuclides in the Pacific Blue Fin Tuna. Studies conducted on 15 migratory Pacific Blue-Fin Tuna Thunnus orientalis caught off the coast of San Diego, California in August 2011 showed that the population was contaminated with Cesium-134 and higher levels of Cesium-137. This attracted intense media coverage and led to widespread public concern over the drift of radioactive contamination all the way from Japan to North America.

Marine life mainly depends on the use of sound for their survival. The ecological footprint of human activity is huge and the effects of which are in dire need of acknowledgement and treatment. Recordings of a boat engine in the open were recorded.This recorder played sounds between frequencies of 20 to 2,000 Hz. Multiple recordings taken at several distances from the hydrophone (underwater microphone) with a built-in amplifier to the boat engine, represented noise levels from very loud at 4 m to only moderately audible at 20 m. The fish were kept in an experimental aquaria constructed of glass in an insulated environmentally controlled room to minimize external noise, with timed lighting, allowing fish to remain on a natural light-dark cycle & were played underwater by an underwater speaker powered by an amplifier. After exposure, cortisol was extracted from each different fish to determine stress response to different noise levels that they were exposed to. A rise in cortisol concentration showed clearly that the recorded boat engine noise was increasing their stress levels. The experiment proves how intermittent noise is stressful to fish in comparison to continuous noise. The sound is represented by a sonar field recording mixed with submarine synthesizer sounds create a representation of underwater sound pollution.",
