    "desc": "Water bends, gyrates, vibrates, elongates, shortens, pulls and pushes. Nearly impossible to pin down, the structure of the water molecule has been hotly debated for decades.  It doesn’t follow the rules of chemistry. It moves against the force of gravity. It changes its form, it changes its shape. Its  solid form floats on its liquid form, it takes the shape of the container it is kept in, it expands when cooled. It is one of the hardest substances to understand, yet it is fundamental to our existence. It is in the background, it is in the foreground. Life needs water, yet water itself is both animate and inanimate. And therefore water structure is everything; it dictates the physics, therefore the chemistry, therefore the biology, therefore life as we know it. A molecule of water, the smallest unit it can be broken down to, has two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. It is the way the oxygen and hydrogen atoms interact that makes water unique.",

This paired chain of billions of nucleotides relies on the presence of polar water molecules around it to maintain its familiar double helix form. Water ensures that our genetic information is packed tightly together, only to be released for metabolic processes. As with DNA, water enables the folding process in proteins, attracting and repelling different parts of the linear chain of amino acids to form all proteins.

It shows an absorption spectrum of 1.4, also known as Water Signature, which corresponds to that of water, indicating the presence of water vapour in its atmosphere.

    "title": "Water Access is Unequal",
    "desc": "The 2016 study published in Our World in Data shows a global link between freshwater access and a country's GDP, raising important questions regarding water access, water scarcity and security. It shows that countries with a higher GDP have better access to freshwater than low- to middle-income countries. High income countries reflect 98-99% of the population having access to an improved source of water between 1990-2016, with upper middle income at 76-95% and middle income countries at 72-92%. Even though upper middle income countries have the second largest percentage of population with improved water sources in the world, there is still a huge gap between countries classified as High Income and Upper Middle Income due to inefficient systems of withdrawal and use, as well as rising population.  Lower income countries as well as countries that are classified as poor, fragile, least developed and indebted are struggling to meet water demands with a growing population. Between 40-70% have access to an improved source of water. Access to clean water should be available for all but a global complacency regarding state regulation has resulted in a divisive gap between sections that can afford the best quality of water and sections with no tangible way of accessing basic clean water.",

    "desc": "A study conducted by State Hydrological Institute, Russian Federation, and United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO, PARIS, 1999) highlights the global consumption of water in the agricultural and industrial sector. Published in 1999, based on data collected between 1975 and 1990, it predicts the global water consumption patterns of 2000 and 2025 based on future needs. It took into account human activities - water withdrawal for agricultural, industrial and municipal activities as well as activities like deforestation, urbanization, population growth and drainage.  Rapid population growth between 1970 and 1994 resulted in a decrease in water availability from 12.9 to 7.6 thousand cubic metres per person annually. The data predicts that by 2025 water withdrawal for agriculture would be around 3128.956 km^3 from which water consumption would be only 2196.66 km^3. The study shows that there is a huge gap in water withdrawal and water consumption in all the sectors. While agriculture consumes the highest, the larger proportion of wastewater is generated in domestic and industrial sectors. The data predicts that if we keep going the same way, our need for freshwater will increase multifold, and so will the waste.",

    "title": "Baseline Water Stress",
    "desc": "The World Research Institute created a water risk mapping tool which essentially measures the baseline water stress of river basins around the world. Baseline water stress is the ratio between the total water withdrawn for use and the annual available renewable water supplies. A logarithmic formula is used to simplify this ratio to a range between 0 and 5, where 0 indicates low stress and 5 indicates very high stress.  It is clear that two variables determine the baseline water stress—water supply availability, and the demand for that water. Water is supplied to the basins through precipitation (snow and rain) or by the melting of glaciers. The demand for water is mainly divided into three sectors—domestic, industrial and agricultural—with the latter usually having the highest baseline water stress. This particular study, published in 2013, collected baseline data of a number of river basins around the world through 1985 to 2012. Out of our selection of 16 river basins, the Sirdaryo basin in Uzbekistan has the maximum stress across all sectors, with a value of 4.78. This is closely followed by the Indus river in north India (4.3) and the Colorado in the USA(4.18). River basins across the globe are being exploited to an unsustainable extent.",
