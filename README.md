“OsmoScape” explores a graphical notation score, where data and graphs related to water have been arranged to form a sound score. The idea is that water recycles across the planet but carries forth the impressions of its environment. Therefore, the viewer via a webApp can read about the data and build a multi layered sound compositions constructed out of user engagement and can be shared over the Internet. Osmoscape is the culmination of three years of research, which seeks to explore a new way of archiving data, and sound that can be intuitively understood through a sound and data based interactions.
